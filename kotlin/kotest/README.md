# Kotlin Kotest

A minimal setup with Kotlin and [Kotest](https://kotest.io/) to get you started.

## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps
    cd kotlin/kotest
    ./gradlew idea

Open the directory in Idea.


## Running Tests

To execute the tests run `./gradlew test` or run the tests from the IDE you are using (e.g. IntelliJ).


## Optimized for Usage of
- Kotlin 1.18.10/Java17
- Gradle 7.3.3
- IntelliJ Idea 2022

It might work with other setups, but that is not tested. Pull requests welcome!
